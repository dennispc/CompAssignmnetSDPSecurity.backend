**Compulsory** Crud For Products (Fullstack + TDD in Core)

We have setup a Get All for Products Project together. We expect you to continue working on that solution.

Now you will have to Add 4 new features.. Read By Id (Details), Create, Update and Delete Product.

The Stories are:

    As A User I would like to See a Single Products Details
    As An Admin I must be able to Delete a Product
    As An Admin I must be able to Create a new Product
    As An Admin I must be able to Update a Product

As mentioned earlier, this must be implemented using CLEAN backend, TDD for CORE and Angular Frontend.

Solve the assignment in groups of 2-4 students. 

Turn in link for your groups github solution to pass the assignment.

Any additional notes for the solution can be added in a README.md file on github. 

***THIS IS A COMPULSORY ASSIGNMENT***
